<h3 id="MORX-24">MORX-24: Contextual Glyph Subsitution Forever</h3>

<div class="desc">
  The <a href="../fonts/TestMORXTwentyfour.ttf">font</a> for this
  test case attempts to run a denial-of-service attack on the
  rendering engine under test. The fontâ€™s finite-state transducer
  substitutes glyph <em>A</em> by <em>B</em>, <em>B</em> by <em>C</em>,
  <em>C</em> by <em>D</em>, <em>D</em> by <em>E</em>,
  and <em>E</em> by <em>A</em>. The transition is marked with
  the <em>DontAdvance</em> flag.
</div>

<div class="desc">
  If your rendering system is immune to this attack, it will detect
  getting stuck (for example, by imposing an upper limit on the number
  of transitions taken by the finite-state machine), and give up quickly.
